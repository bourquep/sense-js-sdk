### Conventional Commits

This repository uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This means that each commit
message must follow a specific format. The format is as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

The `type` must be one of the following:

| Type       | Description                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature.                                                                     |
| `fix`      | A bug fix.                                                                         |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes.                                                        |
| `test`     | Changes to tests.                                                                  |
| `perf`     | A code change that improves performance.                                           |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.                         |
| `style`    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc). |
| `chore`    | Regular maintenance tasks and updates.                                             |
| `build`    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.                     |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.                                     |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit.                                                       |

The `scope` is optional and should be used to specify the part of the codebase that the commit affects.

The `description` should be a short, concise summary of the changes made in the commit. The description will appear
as-is in the release notes, so make sure it is clear, informative and not too technical.

For example:

```
feat: Added support for dark mode
```

### Semantic Versioning

This repository uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means that each release will be versioned
according to the following rules:

- Increment the major version for breaking changes
- Increment the minor version for new features
- Increment the patch version for bug fixes

Releases are automatically generated by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) based
on the commit messages. The version number is determined by the type of commits since the last release.

### Code Style

This repository uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce code style and
formatting. Please make sure that your code follows the linting rules and conventions used in the project.

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that:

- Your code follows the coding standards and conventions used in the project
- The documentation has been updated to reflect any changes
- Your commit messages follow the conventional commits format
- Your changes do not introduce any new linting errors or warnings
